						<h4>Goal</h4>
						<p>
							We hope to promote truth and awareness about Harvey E. Jordan. Jordan is a part of the university’s history, therefore we feel that it is important for our university community to know both the positive and negative aspects that Jordan contributed. We will do so in three major ways.
						</p>
						<h5>Learn</h5>
						<p>
							Foremost, we would like to learn more about Harvey E. Jordan’s impact on the University of Virginia and the surrounding Charlottesville community and then disperse this information to different people around the university grounds. Jordan participated in eugenics which is sterilization of certain people in order to promote a ‘superior’ group of people. Despite his participation, Jordan also contributed to the advancement of medicine and specifically was a Dean of the School of Medicine at the University of Virginia.
						</p>
						<h5>Interview</h5>
						<p>
							In honor of Jordan, the Virginia’s medical building is named ‘Jordan Hall’. Our group would like to conduct interviews with people that work in the building as well as people on campus to identify reactions to knowing the background of Jordan. There are many different perspectives people can take. Some may think that his contributions to the community outweigh his participation in eugenics. Others however might feel as if he does not deserve the honor of having a building named after him.
						</p>
						<h5>Act</h5>
						<p>
							After knowing more about Jordan, we want to record the interviewees’ reactions about Harvey E. Jordan’s eugenics participation, contribution to medicine, as well as having a medical building named after him. If enough interviewees feel a certain way, we would like to help accommodate their view. If most people desire a name change for instance, then we would like to help start a petition to ask for a building name change.
