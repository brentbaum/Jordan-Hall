							I'm a first year English and Physics major from Northern New Jersey. Although up until we discussed Jordan Hall in class, I had no personal connection with the building, throughout my studies at UVA I have been taught at many buildings on Grounds without pausing to consider their history and the origin of their names. As a student here, where I learn and what it represents, whether through the content of the material or the places and people I study it from, reflects on my experience here. As a university, in choosing who to honor and who to discredit, UVA presents an image of the ideals it values to the rest of the world. Therefore, I was shocked to learn about the origin of Jordan Hall, and surprised at the general lack of knowledge regarding the building's namesake. I wanted to create this website in order to bring awareness to the controversial issue, and, if necessary, implement change. UVA is a place I know and love for its diverse people, rigorous academics, and atmosphere; I want that to be the image that the university projects to the rest of the world. I hope that by bringing awareness to the origin of Jordan Hall, students and faculty can decide whether our relation to this controversial doctor is a part of the university's past that cannot be ignored, or whether it is an error that must be acknowledged and rectified.

							My name is Ashley Ferguson and I'm a first year intended neuroscience major at the University of Virginia. As I hope to some day pursue a career medicine and medical research, my tie into the project is the intersect between the sciences and "righting un-rightable wrongs". Often times in the sciences, the desire to discover and treat gives rise to a drive that may trample ethical standards in its wake. In order to assess the role Dr. Harvey Jordan's novel medical practices may have played in his ultimate success, we'd like to take an objective look at both his medical success, and his potential ethical shortcomings. This will be done in the context of our class heading which aims to look at what can be done in the present to address issues that have been found to blemish the past. Ultimately, we'd like to uncover the history of this prominent figure in the University's history, share his work with the public, and gage the community's response both within the University and surrounding Charlottesville setting. Hopefully, we will be able to implement change if it is called for, and if nothing more we'll be able to reach out to those who count UVA as a part of their identity with a small piece of truth from the University's rich history.

							I am a first year student at the University of Virginia and am enrolled in university seminar called “Righting Un-Rightable Wrongs”. In the USEM, we’ve investigated many wrongs that have been committed, ranging from the Armenian genocide through events in the U.S., the Greensboro killings. We have learned that there are no exact ways to right a wrong, but we can work to acknowledge and apply reparations to help a community affected by a wrong recover. I would like to investigate how other people feel about having an amazing medicine center, Jordan Hall, named after Doctor Harvey Jordan. Dr. Jordan made many contributions to the University as well as medicine. However, he also supported and acted in eugenics, racial cleansing through forced sterilization. We can all agree that Dr. Jordan promoted a cause that is acceptable in today’s society. Therefore, I am interested to finding out what reparations the community believes UVA needs to make on behalf of Jordan’s actions, if the community believes that a reparation at all. I think it would be very interesting to hear different perspectives on this topic, and hope that we can uncover different opinions!

                            I am a first year in the engineering school, but heavily interested in global development studies.  It is with great excitement that I pour my energy into this project.  I first heard about Jordan Hall last semester through my Global Development Studies class, where we discussed in depth the implications of our medical center being named after Harvey E. Jordan.  Again, it was brought up in my University Seminar and by then, I’d been antsy to take action. My group and I will research the public opinion on Jordan Hall and from there, move forward.  My connection with Jordan Hall has become strong, as I started working there this semester (my research is focused on epilepsy).  I’ve found that those who regularly work at Jordan Hall don’t seem to realize who Jordan is.  I hope that our work will not only touch students of the University, but also affect the greater  community.						</p>
