                    Through my work in learning about and educating others regarding Jordan Hall, I’ve learned a lot about not only the issue of Harvey E. Jordan and his stance on eugenics, but about the history of the university, its students, and how that influences our culture today. I was surprised by the overall consensus, which was that the name should not be changed. Perhaps it’s because our class has been so focused on reparations and repair, but I thought it would be obviously pro name change. However, many people brought up significant points that I had not considered before, about our responsibility as a university to remember our history. Although it’s hard to accept now, Jordan was a Dean of Medicine here for many years, and we cannot simply sweep such a thing under the rug. In light of that, I think it’s even more important that we educate the university and community at large about Jordan. I was slightly surprised by the survey results, which indicated that most people had not even heard of the hall, let alone the man. If there’s one thing that I hope students take from our project, it is a better knowledge and understanding of UVA’s history, both the good and bad. I hope that our research can help with that.

                    Any given area has so much history that is waiting to be unveiled. Before our project I was unaware of who Harvey E. Jordan was. It is not surprising that many other people around UVA also seem to be unsure of who Jordan is.  Jordan’s negative contributions to the school and science are overshadowed just as Thomas Jefferson’s negative deeds are also hidden.

                    We must learn how to acknowledge the past without harming the present. The most important of our Jordan Hall research is educating more people about Jordan and his past, both good and bad contributions. Increasing education about Jordan can help give us a better consensus on how people feel about the relationship between the negatives and positives that a person does.  The reactions people have about the name Jordan Hall for the UVA medical center can help set precedents for other controversial names. The greatest takeaway from our research has been gauging the community’s opinion as whole.

                    As the project started, I had very lofty goals for the project, namely, could my team and I actually instantiate the movement needed to change the name of the building?  I thought that the overwhelming majority of students would learn about Harvey E. Jordan and Jordan Hall and support the idea of changing the name.  Jordan Hall has been a heavy subject both in this course and in my Global Development Studies course and proved to be very controversial.  However, after interviewing many students, I’ve realized that perhaps the opinions of the people who enroll in these courses and spend lengthy time discussing such unrightable wrongs is not reflective of the entire community.  The interviews have showed that a great number of students defend the history of the University above and beyond any possible reparations that might be able to be made.  Additionally, they question the effectiveness of changing the name of the building, as changing the name could open past wounds and bring about undesirable consequences.  This has demonstrated to me the importance of slowing down and reflecting on an idea.
